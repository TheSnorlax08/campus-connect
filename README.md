# 🚀 CampusConnect.AI 
### *The Intelligent Communication Layer for the Modern Campus.*

---

## 🛑 The Problem
In 2026, campus communication is a **fragmented mess**. Between unofficial WhatsApp groups, ignored emails, and physical posters, important deadlines expire and major events are missed.
- **Notification Fatigue:** Students are overwhelmed by noise.
- **Misinformation:** Unverified news spreads faster than official updates.
- **Zero Engagement Data:** Institutions have no way to track student participation or academic risk in real-time.

## ✨ The Solution
**CampusConnect.AI** is a unified, AI-powered communication layer. We don’t replace existing systems; we integrate with them to provide a **single, verified source of truth** for every student, club, and department. Powered by **Google Gemini**, we turn chaos into structure.

## 🛠 Key Features

### 1. 🤖 Gemini-Powered Automation (OCR)
Clubs simply upload a poster. Our AI instantly extracts the **Title, Date, Time, and Venue**, and syncs it directly to the student's Google Calendar. No manual entry, no errors.

### 2. 📉 Academic Risk AI (Attendance Predictor)
A real-time safety net for students. The system calculates attendance across different subjects and flags **"Critical Zones" (below 75%)**, telling students exactly how many classes they can safely skip to attend campus events.

### 3. 🗓️ 31-Day Habit Dashboard
Inspired by the "Getting 1% Better Every Day" protocol. A fully interactive digital version of the traditional habit tracker where students can edit protocols, track daily points, and visualize progress.

### 4. 🌙 Sleep Rhythm Analytics
Integrated data visualization using **Recharts** to monitor student well-being and sleep cycles, ensuring a balanced campus life.

### 5. 📔 The Spiral Journal
A high-end digital notebook designed with a realistic spiral diary interface. Students can flip pages, note down quick tasks, and maintain a campus checklist.

### 6. 🌐 Unified Developer Tracker
A single hub to track technical growth across **LeetCode, GitHub, Unstop, and CodeChef**. View solved problems, commit history, and upcoming hackathons in one glance.
